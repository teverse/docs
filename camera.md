In teverse, the user views the 3D scene through a camera. You can control the camera's position, orientation and field of view to alter what part of the scene the user can see.

With our Lua api, you can access the camera singleton through `teverse.scene.camera`. Note that your **tevapp manifest** should have permissions to access the scene singleton.
